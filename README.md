# Flight-Price-Prediction

Description: Flight ticket prices are notoriously unpredictable, varying day by day. In this hackathon challenge, we
aimed to demonstrate the predictive power of data science by analyzing and predicting flight ticket prices. We
were provided with historical data of flight ticket prices from March to June 2019 across multiple airlines and
cities. Our goal was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately predict future ticket prices
based on these historical patterns
